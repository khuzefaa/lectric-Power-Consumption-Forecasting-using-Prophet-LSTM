# lectric-Power-Consumption-Forecasting-using-Prophet-LSTM
A time series forecasting project predicting household electric power consumption using historical data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This project implements both Facebook Prophet for trend/seasonality modeling and a lightweight LSTM neural network for sequential prediction.
# Electric Power Consumption Forecasting (Prophet + LSTM)

## üìå Overview
This project predicts **daily household electric power consumption** using two approaches:
1. **Facebook Prophet** ‚Äì for capturing trends & seasonality.
2. **Lightweight LSTM Neural Network** ‚Äì for sequential forecasting.

The dataset comes from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** (Household Power Consumption Dataset).  
The notebook is optimized to run **entirely on CPU**, making it compatible with **free Google Colab** sessions without GPU initialization issues.

## üìä Dataset
- **Source**: [UCI ML Repository - Electric Power Consumption](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption)  
- **Size**: ~2 million rows (minute-level data from 2006 to 2010)  
- **Features used**:
  - `Global_active_power` ‚Äì total active power consumed (kW)
  - Date & Time converted into `Datetime`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Implemented
1. **Data Download** ‚Äì via `kagglehub`
2. **Data Cleaning** ‚Äì handle missing values, type conversions
3. **Resampling** ‚Äì convert minute-level to **daily averages**
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis** ‚Äì trend visualization
5. **Prophet Model** ‚Äì forecast next 30 days
6. **LSTM Model** ‚Äì sequence-based neural forecasting
7. **Visualization** ‚Äì compare actual vs. predicted consumption
